# Laravel Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run a Laravel project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (>= 7.4)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for Laravel Mix)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) (or any other supported database)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-laravel-project.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-laravel-project
    ```

3. Install PHP dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. Install JavaScript dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

6. Generate the application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

7. Configure your database settings in the `.env` file:

    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```

    **Note:** Adjust the database connection details according to your setup.

8. Run the database migrations:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

9. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    Your Laravel application should now be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

10. Visit the application in your web browser, and you're ready to go!

## Additional Commands

- Compile assets during development:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

- Run tests:

    ```bash
    php artisan test
    ```

Feel free to customize this guide according to your specific project requirements. Good luck with your Laravel development!
